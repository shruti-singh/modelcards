The other two sentences remain in the input, but some tokens are randomly masked by [MASK2] (MLM). 1 Introduction Text summarization aims at generating accurate and concise summaries from input document(s). In contrast to extractive summarization which merely copies informative fragments from the input, abstractive summarization may generate novel words. A good abstractive summary covers principal information in the input and is linguistically fluent. In abstractive summarization, sequence-to-sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014) has become a dominant framework using encoder-decoder architectures based on RNNs (Chung et al., 2014; Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and more recently Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Most prior work on neural abstractive summarization relied on large-scale, high-quality datasets of supervised document-summary pairs (Hermann et al., 2015) and achieved promising results (Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017). In recent years, there has been increased interest in collecting new summarization datasets that have more abstractive summaries (Narayan et al., 2018), have longer documents, (Cohan et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2019), utilize multiple documents (Fabbri et al., 2019), and are sourced from diverse domains (Grusky et al., 2018; Koupaee & Wang, 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Kornilova & Eidelman, 2019; Zhang & Tetreault, 2019); ar X\niv :1\n91 2.\n08 77\n7v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n0 Ju\nl 2 02\n0\nhowever, there has been little work on systematic evaluation of models across these broad settings.", "Contemporaneously, the adoption of Transformer models (Vaswani et al., 2017) pre-trained using self-supervised objectives on large text corpora (Radford et al., 2018a; Devlin et al., 2019) have improved performance on many NLP tasks (Wang et al., 2018; Rajpurkar et al., 2016). Recent work leveraging such pre-training for Transformerbased sequence-to-sequence models (Dong et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Rothe et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019) has extended the success to text generation, including abstractive summarization. In this work, we study pre-training objectives specifically for abstractive text summarization and evaluate on 12 downstream datasets spanning news (Hermann et al., 2015; Narayan et al., 2018; Grusky et al., 2018; Rush et al., 2015; Fabbri et al., 2019), science (Cohan et al., 2018), short stories (Kim et al., 2019), instructions (Koupaee & Wang, 2018), emails (Zhang & Tetreault, 2019), patents (Sharma et al., 2019), and legislative bills (Kornilova & Eidelman, 2019). We find that masking whole sentences from a document and generating these gap-sentences from the rest of the document works well as a pre-training objective for downstream summarization tasks. In particular, choosing putatively important sentences outperforms lead or randomly selected ones. We hypothesize this objective is suitable for abstractive summarization as it closely resembles the downstream task, encouraging whole-document understanding and summary-like generation. We call this self-supervised objective Gap Sentences Generation (GSG). Using GSG to pre-train a Transformer encoder-decoder on large corpora of documents (Web and news articles) results in our method, Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive SUmmarization Sequence-to-sequence models, or PEGASUS. With our best 568M parameter model trained on the recently introduced C4 (Raffel et al., 2019) corpus we equal or exceed state-of-the-art on the 12 summarization tasks we consider.", "We further push forward the state-of-the-art using a newly collected text corpus comprised of news-like articles we call HugeNews, including the highly competitive XSum and CNN/DailyMail summarization datasets. Large-scale document-summary datasets are rare and in practice there is a mismatch between research datasets and real-world use-cases where collecting summaries is expensive; the most common setting is that of low-resource summarization. We simulate this setting and show that our model is able to adapt very quickly when fine-tuning with small numbers of supervised pairs, obtaining state-of-the-art results in 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Qualitatively we observed high quality outputs from our\nbest models and validated this in human evaluation studies. We found that PEGASUS summaries are at least as good as reference summaries for the datasets we assessed \u2013 XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Reddit TIFU \u2013 even at low-levels of supervision. To summarize our contributions:\n\u2022 We propose a new self-supervised pre-training objective for abstractive summarization, gap-sentences generation, and study strategies for selecting those sentences. \u2022 We evaluate the proposed pre-training objective on a broad range of downstream summarization tasks, with careful ablations to choose the best model settings, which we use to train a 568M parameter PEGASUS model that surpasses or is on-par with the state-of-theart on all 12 downstream datasets considered. \u2022 We show how good abstractive summarization performance can be achieved across broad domains with very little supervision by fine-tuning the PEGASUS model and surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on many tasks with as little as 1000 examples. \u2022 We conducted human evaluation studies to validate our experimental design and demonstrate human-level summarization performance on XSum, CNN/DailyMail, and Reddit TIFU.", "2 Related Work Dai & Le (2015); Ramachandran et al. (2017) used LM and autoencoder pre-training on in-domain data to improve performance of RNN sequence models. However, the combination of pre-training with much larger external text corpora (such as Wikipedia, books, or Web-pages) and Transformerbased sequence models has led to a dramatic improvement in performance when fine-tuned for both natural language understanding and text generation tasks (Radford et al., 2018a; Devlin et al., 2019; Rothe et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Joshi et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Dong et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2019). Most similar to our approach are Transformer encoder-decoder models pre-trained on some masked input pre-training objective. MASS (Song et al., 2019) proposed masked sequence-tosequence generation that reconstructs a sentence fragment given the remaining part of the sentence. A single sentence fragment was randomly selected. UniLM (Dong et al., 2019) proposed jointly training on three types of language modeling tasks: unidirectional (leftto-right and right-to-left), bidirectional (word-level mask,\nwith next sentence prediction), and sequence-to-sequence (word-level mask) prediction. T5 (Raffel et al., 2019) generalized the text-to-text framework to a variety of NLP tasks and showed the advantage of scaling up model size (to 11 billion parameters) and pre-training corpus, introducing C4, a massive text corpus derived from Common Crawl, which we also use in some of our models. T5 was pre-trained with randomly corrupted text spans of varying mask ratios and sizes of spans. BART (Lewis et al., 2019) introduced a denoising autoencoder to pre-train sequence-to-sequence models. BART corrupted text with an arbitrary noising function and learned to reconstruct the original text. For generation tasks, the noising function was text infilling which used single mask tokens to mask random sampled spans of text.", "In contrast to MASS, UniLM, BART and T5, the proposed PEGASUS masks multiple whole sentences rather than smaller continuous text spans. In our final objective we deterministically choose sentences based on importance, rather than randomly. As in T5, PEGASUS does not reconstruct full input sequences, and only generates the masked sentences as a single output sequence. In this work we focus entirely on downstream summarization (generative) tasks and do not evaluate on NLU classification tasks. There has been some work on the low-resource, summarization setting using the CNN/DailyMail dataset. Radford et al. (2018b) showed that a large Transformer language model pre-trained on Web text could generate summaries if prompted with \u201dTL;DR\u201d, achieving a ROUGE-2 of 8.27 on CNN/DailyMail. Khandelwal et al. (2019) pre-trained a Transformer language model on Wikipedia, and fine-tuned using 3000 examples, achieving 13.1 ROUGE-2. 3 Pre-training Objectives We propose a new pre-training objective, GSG, in this work, but for comparison, we also evaluate BERT\u2019s maskedlanguage model objective, in isolation and in conjunction with GSG. 3.1 Gap Sentences Generation (GSG)\nWe hypothesize that using a pre-training objective that more closely resembles the downstream task leads to better and faster fine-tuning performance. Given our intended use for abstractive summarization, our proposed pre-training objective involves generating summary-like text from an input document. In order to leverage massive text corpora for pretraining, we design a sequence-to-sequence self-supervised objective in the absence of abstactive summaries. A naive option would be to pre-train as an extractive summarizer;\nhowever, such a procedure would only train a model to copy sentences, thus not suitable for abstractive summarization.", "Inspired by recent success in masking words and contiguous spans (Joshi et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019), we select and mask whole sentences from documents, and concatenate the gap-sentences into a pseudo-summary. The corresponding position of each selected gap sentence is replaced by a mask token [MASK1] to inform the model. Gap sentences ratio, or GSR, refers to the number of selected gap sentences to the total number of sentences in the document, which is similar to mask rate in other works. To even more closely approximate a summary, we select sentences that appear to be important/principal to the document. The resulting objective has both the empirically demonstrated benefits of masking, and anticipates the form of the downstream task. We consider 3 primary strategies for selecting m gap sentences without replacement from a document, D = {xi}n, comprised of n sentences:\nRandom Uniformly select m sentences at random. Lead Select the first m sentences. Principal Select top-m scored sentences according to importance. As a proxy for importance we compute ROUGE1F1 (Lin, 2004) between the sentence and the rest of the document, si = rouge(xi, D \\ {xi}),\u2200i. In this formulation sentences are scored independently (Ind) and the top m selected. We also consider selecting them sequentially (Seq) as in Nallapati et al. (2017) by greedily maximizing the ROUGE1-F1 between selected sentences, S \u222a {xi}, and remaining sentences, D \\ (S \u222a {xi}) as in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Sequential Sentence Selection 1: S := \u2205 2: for j \u2190 1 to m do 3: si := rouge ( S \u222a {xi}, D \\ (S \u222a {xi})\n) \u2200i s.t. xi /\u2208 S\n4: k := argmaxi{si}n 5: S := S \u222a {xk} 6: end for\nWhen calculating ROUGE1-F1, we also consider n-grams as a set (Uniq) instead of double-counting identical n-grams as in the original implementation (Orig). This results in four variants of the principal sentence selection strategy, choosing Ind/Seq and Orig/Uniq options.", "An example containing lead, random and principal gap sentence selection strategies are shown in Figure 2.\n3.2 Masked Language Model (MLM) Following BERT, we select 15% tokens in the input text, and the selected tokens are (1) 80% of time replaced by a mask token [MASK2], or (2) 10% of time replaced by a random token, or (3) 10% of time unchanged. We apply MLM to train the Transformer encoder as the sole pre-training objective or along with GSG. When MLM is the sole pre-training objective, the Transformer decoder shares all parameters with encoder when fine-tuning on downstream tasks following Rothe et al. (2019). Figure 1 simultaneously shows how both GSG and MLM are applied to the same example when used in conjunction. However, we found that MLM does not improve downstream tasks at large number of pre-training steps (section 6.1.2), and chose not to include MLM in the final model PEGASUSLARGE (section 6.2). 4 Pre-training Corpus For pre-training we considered two large text corpora:\n\u2022 C4, or the Colossal and Cleaned version of Common Crawl, introduced in Raffel et al. (2019); consists of text from 350M Web-pages (750GB). \u2022 HugeNews, a dataset of 1.5B articles (3.8TB) collected from news and news-like websites from 2013- 2019. A whitelist of domains ranging from highquality news publishers to lower-quality sites such as high-school newspapers, and blogs was curated and used to seed a web-crawler. Heuristics were used to identify news-like articles, and only the main article text was extracted as plain text. CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) dataset contains 93k articles from the CNN, and 220k articles the Daily Mail newspapers. Both publishers supplement their articles with bullet point summaries. We use the non-anonymized variant used in See et al. (2017). NEWSROOM (Grusky et al., 2018) is a large dataset containing 1.3M article-summary pairs written by authors and editors in the newsrooms of 38 major publications between 1998 and 2017.", "Multi-News (Fabbri et al., 2019) is a multi-document summarization dataset consisting of 56k pairs of news articles and their human-written summaries from the site newser.com. Gigaword (Rush et al., 2015) contains 4M examples extracted from news articles (seven publishers) from the Gigaword corpus (Graff et al., 2003). The task is to generate the headline from the first sentence. arXiv, PubMed (Cohan et al., 2018) are two long document datasets of scientific publications from arXiv.org (113k) and PubMed (215k). The task is to generate the abstract from the paper body. BIGPATENT (Sharma et al., 2019) consists of 1.3 million U.S. patents along with human summaries under nine patent classification categories. WikiHow (Koupaee & Wang, 2018) is a large-scale dataset of instructions from the online WikiHow.com website. Each of 200k examples consists of multiple instruction-step paragraphs along with a summarizing sentence. The task is to generate the concatenated summary-sentences from the paragraphs. Reddit TIFU (Kim et al., 2019) contains 120K posts of informal stories from the online discussion forum Reddit, more specifically the TIFU sub-reddit from 2013-Jan to 2018-Mar. The sub-reddit posts strictly follow the rule of writing a descriptive \u201dTL;DR\u201d summary and has higher qual-\n1https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/ catalog/overview\nity than (Vo\u0308lske et al., 2017) (which used more subreddits) based on our manual inspection. We uses the TIFU-long subset (using TLDR as summaries) in the work. AESLC (Zhang & Tetreault, 2019) consists of 18k email bodies and their subjects from the Enron corpus (Klimt & Yang, 2004), a collection of email messages of employees in the Enron Corporation. BillSum (Kornilova & Eidelman, 2019) contains 23k US Congressional bills and human-written reference summaries from the 103rd-115th (1993-2018) sessions of Congress. We do not use the California test set which is out-of-distribution.", "Following Grusky et al., the number of examples and extractive fragment coverage/density for all downstream datasets is illustrated in Appendix A.\n6 Experiments In a similar strategy to Raffel et al. (2019), to save time and computation we conducted pre-training ablation experiments using a reduced-size model with 223M parameters, PEGASUSBASE, smaller batch size, and only 4 of 12 datasets before scaling up pre-training with the best settings to the final 568M parameters, PEGASUSLARGE. The datasets (XSum, CNN/DailyMail, WikiHow and Reddit TIFU) were chosen for diversity in abstractiveness, writing style, and size. available C4 corpus. Note that the y-axis in Figures 3, 4, 5 are normalized by the left-most bar using 13 ( R1 R1base + R2R2base + RL RLbase ) where R1, R2, RL are ROUGE F1 scores and R1base, R2base, RLbase are the scores of the configuration corresponding to the first bar. With more pre-training steps, the model observed more documents in the pre-training corpus. A PEGASUSBASE model trained for 500k (highest we tried) steps did not observe all training examples on C4 nor HugeNews. Appendix B shows the number of pre-training steps had an unsurprisingly positive impact on downstream dataset performance. We used 500k steps for the ablation studies and the large model. 6.1.1 PRE-TRAINING CORPUS\nXSum CNN/DailyMail WikiHow Reddit TIFU 0.90\n0.95\n1.00\n1.05\n1.10 C4 HugeNews\nFigure 3: Effect of pre-training corpus. PEGASUSBASE pre-trained on C4 (350M Web-pages) and HugeNews (1.5B news-like documents). 6.1.2 EFFECT OF PRE-TRAINING OBJECTIVES\nGSG We compared six variants of GSG (Lead, Random, Ind-Orig, Ind-Uniq, Seq-Orig, Seq-Uniq) while choosing 30% sentences as gap sentences. As shown in Figure 4a, IndOrig achieved the best performance followed by Seq-Uniq. Ind-Orig and Seq-Uniq were consistently better (or similar) than Random and Lead across the four downstream datasets.", "Lead had decent performance on the two news datasets but was significantly worse on the two non-news datasets, which agrees findings of lead bias in news datasets (See et al., 2017; Zhong et al., 2019). The results suggest choosing principal sentences works best for downstream summarization tasks, and we chose Ind-Orig for the PEGASUSLARGE. A significant hyper-parameter in GSG is the gap-sentences ratio (GSR). A low GSR makes the pre-training less challenging and computationally efficient. On the other hand, choosing gap sentences at a high GSR loses contextual in-\nformation necessary to guide the generation. We compared GSRs from 15% to 75%. For a fair comparison, the original documents were truncated to have up to 400 words. The maximum input length, Linput in the encoder and the maximum target length, Ltarget in the decoder were set as 512 tokens. on non-news datasets, especially WikiHow. On XSum and CNN/DailyMail, Unigram 96k achieved the highest ROUGE scores. On WikiHow and Reddit TIFU, the best configurations were Unigram 128k and 64k respectively. Therefore, we used the overall best vocabulary option Unigram 96k in PEGASUSLARGE. 6.2 Larger Model Results\nCompared with PEGASUSBASE, the large model PEGASUSLARGE had increased capacity from larger hidden size (H : 768 \u2192 1024, F : 3072 \u2192 4096, A : 12 \u2192 16), number of layers (L : 12 \u2192 16) and traversed much more data, due to larger batch size (B : 256 \u2192 8192) (same number of pre-training steps, 500k). We adopted the best practices found in the PEGASUSBASE ablation studies using the GSG (Ind-Orig) pre-training objective without MLM and Unigram vocabulary size of 96k. In total, PEGASUSLARGE had 568M parameters. To encourage the model to copy, which is an important aspect of the more extractive datasets, we left 20% of selected sentences unchanged in the input instead of replacing with [MASK1]. We increased the GSR to 45% to achieve a similar number of \u201cgaps\u201d as the optimal 30% found above.", "We reported the performance of the models pre-trained on HugeNews and C4 separately. We conducted a simple hyper-parameter sweep of learning rate and length penalty,\nDatasets XSum CNN/DailyMail Reddit TIFU mean (p-value) mean (p-value) mean (p-value) Experiment 1: pretrain comparison Human-written 3.0 (-) 3.1 (-) 3.2 (-) PEGASUSLARGE (HugeNews) 3.0 (0.6) 3.6 (0.0001) 3.2 (0.7) PEGASUSLARGE (C4) 3.1 (0.7) 3.5 (0.009) 3.1 (0.3) TransformerBASE 2.0 (3e-10) 2.9 (0.06) 1.4 (5e-23) Experiment 2: low resource Human-written 3.2 (-) 3.2(-) 3.3 (-) PEGASUSLARGE (HugeNews) 10 examples 2.8 (0.1) 3.4 (0.007) 2.6 (0.006) PEGASUSLARGE (HugeNews) 100 examples 3.2 (0.5) 3.4 (0.08) 2.1 (4e-8) PEGASUSLARGE (HugeNews) 1000 examples 3.4 (0.3) 3.6 (0.07) 2.7 (0.01) PEGASUSLARGE (HugeNews) full supervision 3.4 (0.3) 3.3 (0.1) 2.8 (0.05)\nPEGASUSLARGE could be fine-tuned to generate summaries at comparable quality to TransformerBASE trained on the full supervised datasets ranging from 20k to 200k examples. PEGASUSLARGE also beat previous state-of-the-art results on 6 out of 12 datasets with only 1000 fine-tuning examples. On CNN/DailyMail, with half the number of parameters PEGASUSLARGE demonstrated much better zero-shot (ROUGE2-F=13.28) performance than GPT-2 (ROUGE2F=8.27). Using only 1000 examples, PEGASUSLARGE achieved ROUGE2-F of 19.35, much higher than the 13.1 obtained in Khandelwal et al. (2019) with 3000 examples. 6.4 Qualitative Observations and Human Evaluation\nOverall, we observed high-linguistic quality (in terms of fluency and coherence), closely emulating the style of groundtruth summaries. While some previous work suggested that maximum likelihood training results in repetitive text in model outputs (Welleck et al., 2019) we found this to be rare in our outputs and did not require additional countermeasures to mitigate dis-fluencies.", "Although ROUGE clearly has its draw-backs (Kryscinski et al., 2019), over-penalizing abstractive approaches com-\n6.5 Test-set Overlap with Pre-training Corpus\nThe pre-training corpora are a large collection of documents from the Internet and potentially have overlap with the downstream test sets. In this section, we measured the extent of overlap between the pre-training corpus and downstream datasets. We also studied if the pre-trained model was able to exploit memorization to achieve higher performance on the downstream datasets. To measure the overlap, we calculated similarities between all pairs of downstream test set targets and pre-training documents. We use the ROUGE-2 recall as a similarity measure (common 2-grams / test set targets 2-grams). It is not necessarily exact match even if the similarity score is 1.0. We filtered all test set examples that have similarity to any pre-training example above a threshold, and recalculated the ROUGE scores on the remaining test set. In Figure 7, we conducted this study on the pre-training corpus C4 and test set of XSum, CNN/Dailymail, Reddit TIFU and WikiHow, with a similarity threshold of 1.0 and 0.8. Results show that only XSum has significant amount of overlap 15% to 20%, and filtering those examples does not change ROUGE scores more than 1%. We also manually examined those overlapped examples with similarity of 1.0, and found that the models produce very different summaries compared to the human written ones, suggesting that there was no clear memorization. 6.6 Additional PEGASUSLARGE Improvements\nFollowing our experiments on PEGASUSLARGE pre-trained on C4 and HugeNews, we pre-trained a PEGASUSLARGE model on both corpora and stochastically sampled important sentences. The PEGASUSLARGE (mixed,stochastic) model includes the changes: (1) The model was pre-trained on the mixture of C4 and HugeNews weighted by their number of examples.", "(2) The model dynamically chose gap sen-\nReferences Chung, J., Gulcehre, C., Cho, K., and Bengio, Y.

The order in which the summaries are presented for each task was random per example. Each task was independently done by 3 different workers and we retained the median score across workers for each summary. We paid 1 USD per task and used the following critieria for workers to ensure high-quality:\n\u2022 Location: US\n\u2022 Minimum approval rate: 95%\n\u2022 Minimum HIITs: 1000\nWith this criteria we observed high reproducibility in the conclusions of the huamn evaluation. Multiple runs of the same experiment with different workers meeting this criteria yielded very similar results. The HITT template is provided at https://github.com/google-research/pegasus. In experiment 1, the four summaries corresponded to 3 models (PEGASUSLARGE pre-trained on HugeNews, C4, and TransformerBASE) that were fine-tuned using all the supervised examples along with the reference (human) summary. We sampled 100 examples from each dataset (XSum, CNN/DailyMail, Reddit TIFU). In experiment 2, we evaluated 4 models (PEGASUSLARGE pre-trained on HugeNews fine-tuned using different amounts of supervision, 10, 100, 1000, and all examples) alongside the human summary. To do this with the same template, for each example we randomly selected 4 out of the 5 summaries.", "This resulted in fewer ratings per model, but did not increase the work (and cost) of the task. We used a paired t-test to determine statistical significance when comparing the ratings of two sets of summaries. Figure F.1: A screenshot of the Amazon MTurk HIIT. G Example of summary with relatively low ROUGE2-F but qualitatively good. This figure shows an example model summary from the CNN/DailyMail dataset exhibiting high fluency, coherence, although highly abstractive, and only ROUGE2-F of 16. The model understood that the football team \u201dChelsea\u201d could be paraphrased as \u201dJose Mourinho\u2019s side\u201d and \u201dThe Blues\u201d and highlighted the same four matches to be played.

Figure G.1: A CNN/DailyMail PEGASUSLARGE model summary with relatively low ROUGE2-F of 16, but qualitatively quite good, and factually accurate. H Abstractiveness of Summaries We compared the abstractiveness of model generated summaries with the human-written ones for all downstream datasets. We measured abstractiveness of summaries using average values of extractive coverage and extractive density (Grusky et al., 2018) on each dataset. More abstractive summaries have smaller extractive coverage (more novel words) and smaller extractive density (smaller spans copied from inputs). Figure H.1 shows that the summaries generated by models were all less abstractive than the human-written counterparts.", "However, the models that were finetuned on more abstractive datasets, such as XSum and Reddit TIFU, could generate more abstractive summaries than human-written ones on other datasets.\n0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 average extractive coverage\n100\n101\nav er\nag e\nex tra\nct iv\ne de\nns ity\nXSUM\nCNN/DailyMail\nNESROOM\nMultiNews\nGigawords WikiHowReddit TIFU BigPatent\narXiv PubMed\nAESLC BillSum\nhuman model\nFigure H.1: Comparison of abstractiveness of human written and model generated summaries.

Scarring can be common after a heart attack, making the heart pump less effectively and sometimes fail. Writing in the journal Nature, researchers\nsay the patch may one day revolutionise treatment. During an attack, muscle cells in the heart die because of a lack of blood flow and scientists believe repairing or replacing some of these cells may help reduce long-term damage. In this trial an international team of researchers soaked a collagen patch in a protein known as Fstl1 and stitched it on to the hearts of animals who had experienced heart attacks. Though the protein occurs naturally in healthy hearts, it becomes depleted in a key layer of the heart after an attack. Two weeks later the hearts began to grow fresh muscle cells and new blood vessels, while showing signs of pumping more effectively. Prof Pilar Ruiz-Lozano at Stanford University (which has patented the patch), said: \u201dMany were so sick prior to getting the patch that they would have been candidates for heart transplantation. \u201dThe hope is that a similar procedure could eventually be used in human heart attack patients who suffer severe heart damage.\u201d Commenting on the study in Nature, Prof Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic at Columbia University, said the work \u201dcould lead to entirely new modalities for treating heart infarction\u201d.

This could have devastating effects on global agriculture, as about 75 percent of the worlds crops rely on pollination to grow. The ruling also grants protection to 39 plant species found in Hawaii and three other native animals: the band-romped storm-petrel, the orangeblack Hawaiian damselfly and the anchialine pool shrimp.

The taller you are, the higher your odds of developing cancer, and a new paper has added weight to\nthis. key points Key points: Taller people have more cells in their body, as well as higher levels of a protein that encourages cells to divide and grow For every 10cm over the average height, a person\u2019s risk for cancer increases 10 per cent New analysis of data from big cancer studies supports this, and also finds a few specific cancers to be more or less strongly correlated with height Leonard Nunney, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside, looked at massive cancer databases to find out how the number of cells in a person\u2019s body, using height as a proxy, might affect their risk of developing cancer. Reporting in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, he found being taller and having more cells did mean more cancer overall: For every 10 centimetres over the average height, the risk of developing any cancer increased by around 10 per cent.

Anearlier version of the video went too far in suggesting that climate change was responsible ( read more ). This story was updated on January 19, 2018\nto reflect the more specific location of where the photographs were taken. When photographer Paul Nicklen and filmmakers from conservation group Sea Legacy arrived on Somerset Islandnear the larger Baffin Islandin the Canadian Arctic in late summer, they came across a heartbreaking sight: a starving polar bear on its deathbed. Nicklen is no stranger to bears. From the time he was a child growing up in Canada\u2019s far north the biologist turned wildlife photographer has seen over 3,000 bears in the wild. But the emaciated polar bear, featured in videos Nicklen published to social media on December 5, was one of the most gut-wrenching sights he\u2019s ever seen. \u201dWe stood there cryingfilming with tears rolling down our cheeks,\u201d he said. Video shows the polar bear clinging to life, its white hair limply covering its thin, bony frame. One of the bear\u2019s back legs drags behind it as it walks, likely due to muscle atrophy. Looking for food, the polar bear slowly rummages through a nearby trashcan used seasonally by Inuit fishers. It finds nothing and resignedly collapses back down onto the ground. In the days since Nicklen posted the footage, he\u2019s been asked why he didnt intervene. \u201dOf course, that crossed my mind,\u201d said Nicklen. \u201dBut it\u2019s not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat.\u201d And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear\u2019s misery.

Accompanied by a photographic team, she snapped shots of the dying bear last year while colleague Paul Nicklen shot videoall part of their \u201dmission to capture images that communicate the urgency of climate change,\u201d she writes. \u201dWhen Paul posted the video on Instagram, he wrote, \u2019This is what starvation looks like.\u2019\u201d He also wondered if all 25,000 polar bears would die like this and urged people to reduce their carbon footprint. But he didn\u2019t say climate change had killed this bear. That nuance vanished when National Geographic posted the video with the subtitles \u201dThis is what climate change looks like\u201d and the Washington Post ran a dramatic headline about \u201dgut-wrenching\u201d images. People also responded dramatically, expressing gratitude for validation of climate science, anger the crew hadn\u2019t fed the bear, or a stubborn refusal to acknowledge global warming. \u201dPerhaps we made a mistake in not telling the full storythat we were looking for a picture that foretold the future and that we didnt know what had happened to this particular polar bear\nModel \u201dWe stood there cryingfilming with tears rolling down our cheeks.\u201d That\u2019s Paul Nicklen\u2019s take on a video he posted in December showing a starving polar bear on an island in the Canadian Arctic, National Geographic reports.

It shows the bear on Somerset Island, near the larger Baffin Island, as it searches a garbage can for food. At one point, the bear shows signs of starvation. \u201dWhen scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like,\u201d Nicklen tells National Geographic. \u201dBears are going to starve to death.", "This is what a starving bear looks like.\u201d The video has since been viewed more than 3.5 million times, and Nicklen says it struck a nerve. \u201dIf you have any conscience at all, this video of a starving polar bear will break your heart,\u201d Newsweek states.
